# Course-Flowchart


## Things left to do
- Correct elective pre-recs in order for electives to become available
- Links to all available elective groups (technical, complementary studies, natural studies)
- Light/Dark mode
- Organize the default graph better
- Break up right side courses into 1A, 1B, etc.
